Auto Layout automatically arranges and spaces child elements within frames, components, and instances. It helps create responsive designs that adjust automatically as content changes.

## Adding Autolayout

Add button with plus icon – Click to add Auto Layout to frames, components, and instances.

## Flow Direction

Choose how child elements are arranged:

- **Wrap Vertical** – Arrange items vertically with wrapping to new columns
- **Vertical** – Arrange items top to bottom in a single column
- **Horizontal** – Arrange items left to right in a single row
- **Wrap Horizontal / Grid** – Arrange items horizontally with wrapping to new rows (grid layout)

## Resizing

Control how the frame sizes itself:

- **Width (W):** Toggle between `Hug` (sizes to content) and `Fill` (fills available space)
- **Height (H):** Toggle between `Hug` (sizes to content) and `Fill` (fills available space)

## Alignment

Control how child elements align within the frame using a 3×3 grid. Click any position in the grid to align items. The center position represents center/center alignment. Rows control primary axis alignment, columns control counter axis alignment.

## Gap

Controls spacing between child elements. Enter a value to set the gap.

## Padding

Control internal spacing around child elements:

- **Horizontal Padding** – Sets left and right padding simultaneously
- **Vertical Padding** – Sets top and bottom padding simultaneously

## Clip Content

Checkbox option to hide any child elements that overflow the frame boundaries. Useful for creating clean, contained layouts.
