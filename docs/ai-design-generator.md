Use the AI input from the toolbar to generate mini app screens from a text description. Describe the screen you want, and the AI will create a frame with layout, components, and styling for you.

## Enable the AI Input

| Icon | Tool | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| ![AI Input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Diskyeth/FigClank-Studio/d55f9112804375334214c3cbc9e967a07507aee3/docs/doc_resources/icons/ai-sparks.svg) | **AI Input Toggle** | In the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, tap the AI (sparks) icon to show or hide the AI input panel. |

When the AI input is on, the icon is highlighted and a floating panel appears just above the toolbar with a text area and a Generate button.

## Describe Your Mini App Screen

![AI Create input panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Diskyeth/FigClank-Studio/d55f9112804375334214c3cbc9e967a07507aee3/docs/doc_resources/images/FAQ_Ai_Create.png)

In the text area, describe the mini app screen you want the AI to design. Be specific about:

- The purpose of the screen (e.g., login, profile, feed, settings)
- Key elements you want (buttons, inputs, images, lists)
- Tone or style if it matters (minimal, playful, professional)

Then click **Generate**. The AI will create a frame and add it to your canvas. Generation can take up to a minute.

## Example Prompts

- **Login:** "Create a mini app login screen with email and password fields and a sign-in button."
- **Profile:** "Create a user profile screen with avatar, name, bio, and a follow button."
- **Feed:** "Create a feed screen with a list of cards, each with an image, title, and short description."
- **Settings:** "Create a settings screen with toggles for notifications and theme, and a logout button."

## After Generation

The generated frame is added to your canvas. You can select it, move it, and edit any of its layers (text, shapes, layout) using the same tools and sidebar as with manually created content.
